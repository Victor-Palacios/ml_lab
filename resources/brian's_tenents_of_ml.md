Brian's Tenets of ml

- Keep the goal the goal.

    Why are you doing machine learning? Who is this for? A clear goal will make future choices easier. Academic projects are very different than industry projects. 

- Design systems well.

    Machine learning requires many components. Currently, the most difficult part is selecting and applying the correct components. The challenge of contemporary machine learning is building a working and robust system to accomplish the intended goal with minimal side effects.

- Be precise in language.

    You have to use the correct machine learning terms at all times. It will keep your thinking precise and help communicate clearly to collaborators. This is especially critical during learning how to use machine learning. That way sloppy language habits will not have to be unlearn.      

- End-to-end quickly.

    It is not clear you that understand the problem and the solution space until you have a complete, working system. The problem might be easy (or possibly impossible). After getting a system working, then modular elements can be swapped out and explored.
    
- Data matters.

    The quality and quantity of data are important to meaningful machine learning. In particular, quality drives impact.

    The fundamental structure of data impacts what can be done. Know and apply "[level of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)".

    Feature engineering can make (or break) model performance. Collect all tricks and techniques as you learn about machine learning.

- That is an empirical question.

    Contemporary machine learning is a practitioners domain. A majority of questions can be answered with cross-validation, including hyperparameters. Know the pragmatic ways to search hyperparameter space.

    Remember - Different algorithms will perform better on different datasets. You often do not know which best algorithms will perform best before applying to the actual data.

- Plan for what is next.

    Contemporary machine learning is iterative. It is rare to have fixed, batched data. There will almost always be new data and new questions. Build systems that thrive on being updated. Learn to apply incremental updates to every step.
