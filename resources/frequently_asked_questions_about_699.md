Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about 699 Machine Learning Lab
============

What is the relationship between 621 and 699?
-----------

621's focus is the implementation of machine learning algorithms. 699's focus is the hand-ons application of machine learning with Python's scikit-learn package.

You happen to be taking both courses in the same module and some of the content may overlap.

However, you should think of them as entirely separate courses. I'll do my best to reference 621 as much as possible to help you draw connections. But given 621 has very different goals and pace than 699, there is no way to synchronize the courses.

Machine learning can be nuanced and complex. It is important to be exposed to different perspectives on machine learning. If 629 and 699 happen to cover the same material, the different courses and different instructors will offer different perspectives.

Here is how 621 and 699 topics align according to the [621 Syllabus](https://github.com/parrt/msds621#regularization-for-linear-models):

| Week   | Tuesday (621)                 | Thursday (621)                     | Friday (699) |

I'm already a Kaggle grandmaster and know everything about this topic. Do I still have to take this course?
---------------
    
Yep! This course is for __all__ MSDS students. It is designed to teach each student procedural fluency in scikit-learn. It might be review / easy for you. Given the importance of machine learning in a data science career, being very strong in machine learning fundamentals will help you in your career.

More importantly - I want to enlist your help. Please step-in to add additional commentary to my lesson and help out your fellow students. I welcome other points of view. And you would be surprised on what you know (and don't know) when you try to teach others.

What about X package?
----

The goal of the course is procedural fluency with the scikit-learn package. We may expand that to cover related packages in the machine learning ecosystem. But we are not covering all packages, especially new (and unproven) packages.

I have super random questions about machine learning. Can I ask them?
----------

Of course! [My hobby is answer super random machine learning questions](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users/1330/brian-spiering).

The best medium is the course's Slack channel. That way other students can benefit from the discussion (and may even contribute better answers than me). You can also DM me, ask in office hours, or ask during class.
