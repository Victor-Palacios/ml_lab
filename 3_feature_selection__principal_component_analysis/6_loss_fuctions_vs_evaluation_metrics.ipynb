    "\n",
    "The McNamara Fallacy is named after former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, who, during the Vietnam War, based his related decisions on quantitative metrics which were easily obtainable while ignoring others. This led to his treatment of body counts (easily obtainable metric) as the sole indicator of success, at the expense of all other quantitative measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without dispensing much mental power, it should be relatively straightforward to see how a simple body count comparison could lead you astray when evaluating your performance on the battlefield. As one simple example, perhaps the enemy is pushing into your territory with disproportionate numbers of fighters and taking control as they do, but are losing slightly more bodies than you are as they do so. As another, perhaps the enemy is taking your fighters prisoner at a much higher rate than you are killing theirs. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting the statistical blinders on and placing all of your trust in a single, simple metric wasn't good enough to paint a full picture of what was happening in Vietnam, and it's not going to paint a full picture of whatever it is that you are doing."
